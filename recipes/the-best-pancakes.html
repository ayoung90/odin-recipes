    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Best Pancake Recipe - This tasty pancake recipe is easy and has a secret ingredient that gives them the
        perfect fluffy pancake consistency.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Butter for greasing the pan -about 3 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Maple syrup for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, add the milk, sour cream, sugar, eggs, and vanilla. Whisk until combined. It's ok to have
            small
            lumps of sour cream.</li>
        <li>Add the flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir just until no large clumps of dry flour remain, trying not to
            over
            mix. The batter should be very lumpy.</li>
        <li>Melt about ½ tablespoon of butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium-low heat until lightly bubbling
            and
            light brown.</li>
        <li>Ladle the batter into the skillet making 3-4 pancakes (about ¼ cup of batter each). Cook 3-4 minutes, until
            bubbles form on top of each pancake and the bottoms are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Flip the pancakes. Cook 1-2 minutes, until the bottoms are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Carefully wipe out any excess browned butter with paper towels. Repeat with the remaining butter and pancake
            batter.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with maple syrup.</li>
    </ol>
