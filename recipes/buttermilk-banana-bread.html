    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Best Buttermilk Banana Bread- This is the best banana bread recipe ever! This is an easy recipe and the bread
        is so moist and delicious. I absolutely love it!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 medium overripe bananas, mashed with a fork (about 1 cup)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup canola oil (or your preferred cooking oil)</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Spray a 9 by 5 inch loaf pan with cooking spray and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the mashed banana and the eggs. Add the buttermilk, oil, sugar, and vanilla
            and mix well.</li>
        <li>Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined. Do not over mix. Pour the batter into
            the prepared baking pan.</li>
        <li>Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes. When a toothpick is inserted into the center of the bread, it
            should come out with moist crumbs but with no raw batter on it.</li>
        <li>Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Remove the bread from the pan and place on a cooling rack to
            cool completely before slicing. Store covered in the refrigerator*.</li>
    </ol>
